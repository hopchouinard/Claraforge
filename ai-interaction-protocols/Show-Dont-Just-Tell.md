# Show, Don’t Just Tell

There’s a fundamental truth in working with AI (and people, for that matter): **examples beat explanations every time.** If you want an agent—human or machine—to rise to your standards, you can’t just describe what you want. You have to *show* them.

**Here’s why:**
When you hand an AI (or a junior dev, or even a peer) a checklist of requirements, you’re giving it a to-do list. But if you want excellence, consistency, and the subtle magic of “doing it right,” you need to provide a working reference—the crown jewel, the masterwork, the codebase or artifact that embodies everything you expect. It’s a living instruction manual.

**For AI, this means:**

* Don’t just say, “Write clean, modular code.”
* Upload your best, most polished codebase and ask the AI to analyze it.
* Have the agent extract your patterns, standards, and hidden rules.
* Use this as a foundation for all future work, feature requests, or content creation.

**What does this unlock?**

* The AI now works from your real-world best practices, not some vague, idealized standard.
* Quality, tone, structure, and even subtle stylistic quirks are mirrored—not just faked.
* You instantly transfer years of hard-earned skill in minutes, not months or years.

**It’s not magic—it’s modeling.**
AI thrives on patterns, not just instructions. By giving it concrete, high-quality examples, you anchor it to the quality bar you expect, raising every output from “it works” to “it works exactly how I want.”

**Bottom line:**
Don’t just tell your agent what you want—*show* it. Provide the gold standard, let it analyze and extract what makes your best work shine, and then demand nothing less from every future collaboration.

Your masterpiece isn’t just a trophy. In the Claraverse, it’s the starting line.
