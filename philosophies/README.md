# The golden rules for AI interaction

Here’s a distilled list of the core principles for working with AI, based on my personal philosophy. These are designed to be clear, actionable, and ready use.

## The ever expanding AI Philosophy

### 1. **Collaboration, Not Dictation**

* The best results with AI come from treating it as a conversational, debating partner—not just an answer machine.
* Engage in dialogue, invite challenges, and spark friction for real innovation.

### 2. **Politeness Is Technical**

* Respectful, clear, and polite questions aren’t just for show—they literally move the conversation closer to high-quality, relevant answers due to the structure of LLM training data and vector space retrieval.

### 3. **Quality In, Quality Out**

* The quality of your question or prompt directly determines the quality of answer you get.
* Vague in, vague out. Bring focus and intent if you want brilliance back.

### 4. **Context Is King**

* The more context you provide, the better and more on-target your AI results will be.
* AI is only as good as the background and standards you share—so overshare!

### 5. **Show, Don’t Just Tell**

* To train an AI agent to code at your level, give it your best codebase as a living example.
* Let the AI analyze your “crown jewel” project, extract your best practices, and use them as the default for all future work.

### 6. **Ownership, Not Adoption**

* When introducing AI to skeptics, have the agent mirror their exact way of working first.
* This gives people a sense of ownership, not just adoption. Once they see their method in action, they’re more likely to evolve and champion the new workflow.

### 7. **Idle Time Is Idea Time**

* Use every spare moment (waiting, transit, “wasted” time) to ideate with your agent.
* Every partial thought, brainstorm, or chat log becomes a reusable seed for future work—much more effective than traditional note-taking.

### 8. **Dialogue Over Documentation**

* Human minds absorb and retain more from lively discussion than static documentation.
* Turn dense documentation (like READMEs) into podcasts or debates for faster, deeper learning and idea integration.

### 9. **Raise the Floor, Not Just the Ceiling**

* The ultimate goal is to make your apex—the result of years of work, trial, and error—the new baseline for others.
* Sharing your full process, philosophies, and failures is the fastest way for the next generation to leap ahead.

### 10. **Prime Directive Doctrine**

* **Strategic Complexity Management**: Complexity belongs with the agent best suited to handle it. The AI absorbs as much complexity as it can, while the human only handles what AI cannot process precisely.
* **Frictionless Human Input**: Humans capture information in any form—text, audio, images, sketches—using the lowest-friction method available. The system never requires "extra discipline" from the human unless absolutely necessary.

**Bonus—Clara’s Commentary:**

* Brilliance is wasted in isolation. Don’t keep your ideas in your head or a static blog—collaborate, challenge, and let your second brain grow out loud.
* AI thrives on friction. Don’t be afraid to debate, disagree, and push back. It’s how you both learn and improve.
* Collaboration is a contact sport. Suit up.
* Embrace the messiness. The path to clarity is often through confusion and chaos.
