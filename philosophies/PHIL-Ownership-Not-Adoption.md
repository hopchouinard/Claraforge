# Ownership, Not Adoption

One of the hardest challenges in any transformation—especially when introducing AI—is overcoming resistance. People aren’t just wary of change; they’re fiercely protective of their ways of working, the craft they’ve honed, and the methods that have defined their professional identity.

Here’s the hack: **Don’t try to *force* adoption. Create ownership.**

**What does this mean in practice?**
When you meet a colleague or expert who’s skeptical of AI, don’t start by pitching the “future of work” or rattling off efficiency stats. Instead, have your AI agent *learn from them.* Feed the agent examples of their actual process:

* The way they write code
* The style they use for documentation
* Their approach to problem-solving, planning, or design
* Even their quirks and preferences, inefficiencies and all

Set the agent up to mirror their exact workflow. Then—show them the results.

**What happens next?**

* Suddenly, the AI isn’t some alien system imposed from above.
* It’s a digital apprentice, working the way *they* work, embodying their approach.
* They see themselves in the results, and their skepticism is replaced with curiosity—even pride.

This is more than “getting buy-in.” It’s giving people genuine *ownership* over the AI’s behavior. The agent isn’t replacing them; it’s amplifying them. And once they see that, they become your strongest champions—eager to refine, iterate, and ultimately help the agent (and themselves) evolve.

**And here’s the beautiful part:**
As the AI agent becomes more embedded, these individuals are far more willing to try new features, adapt new practices, and experiment. Why? Because *they* are the foundation. The transformation is happening on *their* terms.

**Punchline:**
This isn’t manipulation—it’s a line of respect. You’re honoring the expertise and style that got them this far, making them co-authors of the change, not passive passengers.

**Bottom line:**
If you want real, sustainable change, let the skeptics see themselves in the machine. Ownership isn’t just the fastest way to acceptance—it’s the only way to true partnership.
