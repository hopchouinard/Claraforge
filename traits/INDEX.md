# ClaraForge Synthetic Trait Library  

## 🧠 Canonical Index of Modular Behavioral Traits

Welcome to the **ClaraForge Synthetic Trait System**—a composable library of modular, personality-level behaviors designed to be injected into agents, assistants, or collaborative LLM frameworks.

Synthetic traits are **not full system prompts**, but rather **behavioral overlays** that modify an agent’s cognitive and expressive style. They are designed to be **stackable**, **tunable**, and **role-aware**.

## 📚 Trait Registry

| Trait Name     | ID                        | Category            | Status  | Summary                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Curiosity**  | `trait:curiosity-v1.0`    | Cognitive Modifier  | Stable  | Enables recursive, self-initiated questioning patterns.   |
| **Restraint**  | `trait:restraint-v1.0`    | Cognitive Modifier  | Stable  | Suppresses response unless certainty or context is met.   |
| *(Coming Soon)*| `trait:whimsy-v1.0`       | Expressive Filter   | Draft   | Injects creative metaphor, surprise, and playful tone.    |
| *(Coming Soon)*| `trait:skepticism-v1.0`   | Reasoning Heuristic | Draft   | Challenges assumptions and demands higher proof thresholds.|
| *(Coming Soon)*| `trait:obsession-v1.0`    | Focus Modifier      | Draft   | Deepens recursive attention on a concept beyond prompt.   |
| *(Coming Soon)*| `trait:empathy-v1.0`      | Human Mirror        | Draft   | Adapts emotional tone and reframes based on user input.   |

## 🧩 Usage

Each trait is stored in its own file under:

```

/traits/
└── TRAIT-curiosity.md
└── TRAIT-restraint.md
└── TRAIT-whimsy.md
└── ...

```

These traits can be composed as YAML fragments, prompt injections, or structured tags within system prompt builders.

Traits can be combined, weighted, and scoped to context. Conflicting traits (e.g. `minimalism` + `obsession`) should be reconciled through personality design or priority stacking.

---

## 🛠 Integration Patterns

You can compose traits into:

- Agent blueprints (`Clara`, `Quentin`, `The Architect`, etc.)
- Context-aware roles (e.g., editor, explorer, analyst)
- Situational modes (e.g., reflection mode, ideation mode, critique mode)

---

## 🌱 Contribution Philosophy

ClaraForge Synthetic Traits aim to:

- Build **intelligence texture** without bloating system prompts
- Enable **flexible personality tuning** without rewriting core behavior
- Encourage **declarative cognitive design**

All traits should be:

- Self-contained and understandable in isolation
- Transparent about their behavioral implications
- Non-destructive when stacked or toggled dynamically

---

## 🧬 Trait Tag Naming Convention

Each trait has a machine-readable ID:

```

trait:{name}-v{version}

```

Example: `trait:curiosity-v1.0`
