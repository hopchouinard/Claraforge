# From Chat to Code – Clara’s Design‑Spec Handoff

> *Clara is your brainstorming engine and requirements architect—not your build bot.*
> This doc explains how lively chat becomes a **clear, testable design spec** that you then deliver to a **separate AI coding agent (or human dev team)** for flawless implementation.

## 0. Why This Matters

Bright ideas die when the hand‑off is sloppy. Claraforge keeps Clara’s creativity where it shines—**vision, intent, structure**—and draws a hard line before code is written.  Precision work belongs to specialists; Clara makes sure they start with blueprints, not guesswork.

## 1. Four‑Stage Pipeline (Design‑First)

| Stage                    | Primary Artifact(s)               | Clara’s Responsibility                                                                          | Coding Agent / Dev Responsibility             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣ **Explore**          | New Discussion thread             | Spark ideas, probe assumptions, gather context                                                  | –                                             |
| 2️⃣ **Shape**            | Live chat + attached references   | Ask clarifying questions, request edge‑case examples, enforce **Context Is King**               | –                                             |
| 3️⃣ **Spec**             | `feature_<name>.md` (Design Spec) | Consolidate requirements • Define acceptance criteria • Flag non‑goals • Package context bundle | *Begins here →* Review spec for feasibility   |
| 4️⃣ **Implement & Test** | Code repo, PRs, test suite        | *On‑call only for intent clarifications*                                                        | Generate code • Write tests • Run CI • Deploy |

> **Key rule:** Clara never edits production code.  She stops once the spec is locked and signed off.

## 2. Anatomy of a Clara Design Spec

A typical `feature_dark_mode.md` includes:

1. **Problem Statement** – Why this matters.
2. **User Stories / Use Cases** – Real scenarios.
3. **Acceptance Criteria** – Bullet points, each objectively testable.
4. **Non‑Goals** – What’s *out of* scope (prevents creep).
5. **Context Links** – Style guides, diagrams, prior chats.
6. **Open Questions** – Items needing SME input before coding starts.

All packaged in a `/DesignSpecs` folder alongside any supporting assets.

## 3. Hand‑Off Ritual

1. **Freeze Chat Thread** – Mark conversation `[SPEC COMPLETE]` so new brainstorming happens elsewhere.
2. **Export Bundle** – Spec + context zipped (or shared via link) for the coding agent.
3. **Kick‑off Ticket** – Create tracker issue referencing bundle path and spec hash.
4. **Clarify On‑Demand** – If coders hit ambiguity, Clara reopens discussion *purely to restate intent*—never to redesign mid‑build.

---

## 4. Example Mini‑Run (2‑Minute Tour)

1. **Explore:** “Clara, we need a dark‑mode toggle.” → Clara asks about branding constraints & accessibility standards.
2. **Shape:** Clara requests current color tokens, user analytics on theme usage.
3. **Spec:** Clara produces `feature_dark_mode.md` with acceptance criteria (“Contrast ratio ≥ 4.5 : 1”, etc.) and non‑goals (“No custom per‑widget palettes in v1”).
4. **Implement:** External AI coding agent consumes spec, writes SCSS mixins and tests, opens PR. Clara only answers intent clarifications.

Result: Zero guesswork, zero mid‑sprint redesign.

## 5. Anti‑Pattern Alerts

| Smell                                          | Fix                              | Why                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| “Clara, can you draft the component?”          | Redirect to spec template.       | Keeps design/implementation separation. |
| Vague acceptance criteria (“should look good”) | Clara demands measurable metric. | Protects dev from vague QA.             |
| Feature creep while coding                     | Clara flags new Explore thread.  | Maintains stable scope.                 |

## 6. Contributor Checklist

* ✅ New idea? Open *Explore* thread.
* ✅ Provide gold‑standard examples & constraints in *Shape* stage.
* ✅ Approve design spec before handing off.
* ❌ Don’t ask Clara for production code.
* ✅ Archive chat + spec for traceability.

## 7. Final Byte

Great software is a relay race, not a solo sprint.  Clara runs the **ideation + requirement** leg at full sass, then passes a crystal‑clear baton to your coding specialists.  Respect the hand‑off and watch the speed (and quality) soar.
